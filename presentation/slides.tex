	\begin{frame}{Background}
		In 1968 the NATO SCIENCE COMMITTEE had a conference\textemdash{}and produced a report\textemdash{}on `software engineering'.\cite{naurSoftwareEngineering1968}. This was a landmark event, spruning the formation of `software engineering' as a discipline; culminating in a general appreciation of a crisis in programming.\cite{macroCraftSoftwareEngineering1987}\\[2.5mm]

		Focussed on in my research is the proceeding\textemdash{}from that NATO conference\textemdash{}on software components \cite{mcilroyMassProducedSoftwareComponents1968}, i.e., mass development of mass customisable software.\\[2.5mm]

		Related foci in my research are: problems of deployment at scale; keeping up-to-date with the massive amount of new \glsentrylong{ML}; and pulling all these together to facilitate \textit{scalable rapid software engineering}.

		\textbf{Work (since 2009)}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[0.] Tech support;
			\item Software engineer;
			\item Senior technology specialist;
			\item Senior software engineer
			\item Lead software engineer
			\item Head/director (running my own engineering consultancy)
		\end{enumerate}		

		\textbf{Education}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[0.] 2014: Bachelor of Science (wherein I took most all required to get all Computer Science, Information Technology, and Business Information Systems majors) from Macquarie University.
			\item 2021: Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) from the University of Sydney.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{Problem (0/1)}
		My experience, verified by speaking at dozens and attended{\raise.17ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}}100 industry technology events, and further confirmed from the literature, exposed major problems in software-engineering. The ones I am focussing on in this PhD are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Native development benefits from targeting iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, Android, and Linux.\\
			\(\hdots\)but this greatly reduces development agility and quality metrics like consistency and test \& doc coverage.
			\item \glsentrylong{ML} field changes too quickly for anyone to keep up-to-date with. Meaning one cannot claim superiority of their solution across industry/academia.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{Problem (1/1)}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The same stack cannot be deployed for: embedded (e.g., whole stack on smarthpone); peer-to-peer; and client/server architectures.
			\item Deploying to different clouds requires a different knowledge set.
		\end{itemize}
	    
		In summary, developing quality, complex and multi-tier systems requires:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item a team;
			\item increasingly specialised knowledge;
			\item lots of time; and
			\item an expansive budget.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{Solution}
		Write compilers.
